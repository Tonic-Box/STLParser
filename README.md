# STLParser
This is my rewrite/overhaul of [D3Parser](https://github.com/CaiMiao/D3Parser). It is for parsing data out of `*.STL` files and parsing the data into hashed GBID lists.  
  
### Instructions
**1.** Place your `.STL` file inside the `StringList\` folder (One at a time)  
**2.** Run `D3Parser.exe`  
**3.** It will parse and dump a raw list as well as a hashed GBID list from the `.STL` file into 2 new folders it will create:  
* `RAW_STRINGS/` - Contains the Raw List dump  
* `GBIDs/` - Contains the Hashed GBID list

# The Plug
This is largely a rewrite of [https://github.com/CaiMiao/D3Parser](https://github.com/CaiMiao/D3Parser)
